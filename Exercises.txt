sold. Each item has a name, price and quantity, separated by a comma.

Create a new file called "summary.csv", located in a subfolder called "out"
from the original folder of the source file, containing only the name and
total value for that item.

Example:
Source file:
Smart TV LED 50 4K Philco,350.00,2
Console PlayStation 5,600.00,1
Iphone 15,700.00,2
Notebook Lenovo,500.00,3

Project: CarRental
A car rental company charges a rental fee. If the rental is longer than 12 hours, a daily
fee is charged. In England, a 20% fee is also charged for rentals up to $100.00 and 15%

Create a program that reads the rental data (car model, rental start and rental finish) and
the hourly and daily rental rates. Generate a payment receipt with the rental amount, tax
amount and total payment amount.

Example:
Enter rental data:
Car model: Civic
Pickup (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 25/06/2025 10:30
Return (dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm): 27/06/2025 11:40
Enter price per hour: 10.00
Enter price per day: 130.00
Invoice:
Basic payment: $390.00
Tax: $58.50

paid with date and amount.

Example:
Enter contract data:
Number: 1240
Date (dd/MM/yyyy): 28/07/2025
Total value: 600.00
